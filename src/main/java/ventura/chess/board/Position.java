/**
 * The position of one piece in a board.
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)
 *
 *
 * Each square of the chessboard is identified by a unique coordinate pairâ€”a
 * letter and a number. The vertical columns of squares, called files, are
 * labeled a through h from White's left (the queenside) to right (the
 * kingside). The horizontal rows of squares, called ranks, are numbered 1 to 8
 * starting from White's side of the board. Thus each square has a unique
 * identification of file letter followed by rank number. (For example, White's
 * king starts the game on square e1; Black's knight on b8 can move to open
 * squares a6 or c6.)

// In either algebraic or descriptive chess notation, en passant captures are sometimes denoted by "e.p." or similar, but such notation is not required. In algebraic notation, the capturing move is written as if the captured pawn advanced only one square; for example, ...bxa3 or ...bxa3e.p. (see beginning illustration).[4]:216
